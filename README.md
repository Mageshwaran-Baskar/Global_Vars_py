# Global_Vars_py

This GLOBAL_VARS_DB_connection.py  script updates the Global Variables dynamically in the presence of reload_test_file.config when it is called.

The purpose why i wrote this script is to update Global Variables dynamically when some value has been inserted into DB from UI end ; post UI update from dotnet this API is called which internally writes the Global vars file.
